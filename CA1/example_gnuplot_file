# This is an example gnuplot script for plotting the temperature
# values in first coursework assigment (heat transfer).
# It is assumed that the data to be plotted are in a file called
# temperature.dat which contains 3 columns: x,y,temperature
# The plot is sent to a postscript file called temperature.ps 
# To use this file copy it to the directory/folder containing 
# temperature.dat and run the command: 
# gnuplot example_gnuplot_file 


# Send output to a PDF file. 14 refers to the font size
set terminal png color enhanced 14
# Set the name of the output file
set output "temperature.png"

# Set ranges and labels for axes
set xrange [0:0.1]
set yrange [0:0.1]
set xlabel "x (m)"
set ylabel "y (m)"

# Plot the data 
plot "temperature.dat" with image 

# End of file
